  The repository has 3 different folders. There's "daal4py", which is actually a wrapped model from "daal4py". I wrapped it for "intel/dffml" and it has been merged along with plenty other contributions to the open source organization. Dffml has made wrapping models pretty convenient by having a format ready to kick-start the model, however, my job was to figure out how the actual model is installed, how it works, and how to adapt it to dffml and its components. 
  
  The second folder is of a coursera course final project which was actually a kaggle competition. Although I picked out the course to learn a few selected things, however, I proceeded with the final project. Some parts of the project reuse code from another notebook and the credits are mentioned in the notebook. I had to cut down a couple of features and data evaluations and EDA as it was taking excessive resources. 
  
  The third folder "Facial Expression Recognition" is of a guided project I worked on coursera. Obviously, there was a lot of help from the instructor with helping functions etc, but I got to work on Conv. Nets architecture and using them to create a web-app to recognize facial expressions.  
  
## Directions for "daal4py":
  
  My code contributions mainly are included in the following: 
  
  1. `daal4py/dffml_model_daal4py/daal4pylr.py` 
  2. `daal4py/tests`
  3. `daal4py/examples/lr`
  
## Directions for "competitive-data-science-final-project":
  
  Please find the notebook `competitive-data-science-final-project/predict-future-sales-xgboost.ipynb` included in the folder containing all the code related to the      project.

## Directions for "FacialExpressionRecognition":

  Please find the notebook `FacialExpressionRecognition/Facial_Expression_Training.ipynb` included in the folder containing the my code in the guided project.
